# bootstrap-login-form

This was simply a login form that I had proposed to my Design group whenever we were creating the website for our daycare client.  The only functionality that it has is that the username & password accept entries, and the reset button works.  Had my group gone with my idea, then there would have been:  error message (if either username and/or password did not match what was in the database, thus prompting the user to 'try again'), there would have been a landing page (if correct entries matched what was in the database for the username and password).
